Notes from call with Daniel 10/7/15:

Suggestions:

- Get rid of the SetRetainInstance true settings - shouldn't be necessary
- Don't need ServiceFragment (not so sure about this one)
- A Started Service should remain playing even if the calling activity is killed
- Watch out when calling getActivity.blah.blah.blah - after a rotation, it's a new instance
  of Activity
- Change to a simpler ChangeTextListener, the one that triggers on the Search or Done key.

Additional questions for coaches:

I've been stuck for some time on the same problem, and in fact I may be adding more defects in an
attempt to fix the problem.  I failed the P2 submission primarily because the app would crash on
rotation.  I was given the guidance to add the following to onDestroyView() in PlayerFragment:
        // Workaround for DialogFragment self-destruct per
        // https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=17423
        if (getDialog() != null && getRetainInstance())
            this.getDialog().setOnDismissListener(null);

Alas, that was not sufficient, but I (much later) figured out that I was using a mix of Fragment
and SupportFragments in various modules.  I've corrected that, going for SupportFragments across
the board.  I am still getting run-time exceptions on rotation.

It may be rooted in the way I'm trying to persist the PlayerService.  Following the suggestion to
 rap the service in a fragment that is persisted so that the Service stays alive, I created
 ServiceFragment.java, which does just that- it's called at startup, and I've tried binding as
 well as starting + binding.  The error that gets me is that I have a Leaked ServiceConnection
 when MainActivity is destroyed and recreated.  If I close the ServiceConnection, the player
 stops because the service is no longer bound.  The error message gives me the line where the
 Service Connection is created, but I can't figure out where to catch the exception.

A second problem that has eluded me (I'm very embarrassed to tell you how many hours I've spent
on these problems) is the call to searchSpotifyArtists (an AsyncTask) in FindArtistFragment.  I
can see that I've successfully persisted the ArtistsArray through the rotation and shouldn't need
to make a network call to get the data, but I do.  I believe I only call that function from the
afterTextChangedListener.  I've come to the conclusion that that listener is fired when the
existing artist search text is restored, so I tried to set the flag newView when savedInstanceState
is null, and setting the flag after the first call to searchSpotifyArtists.  I don't know why that
search is being triggered, and it breaks the specs.

Thanks!
